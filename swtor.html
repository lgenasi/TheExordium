								<h4>
								<b><ins>Welcome to the Exordium SWTOR Guild</ins></b>
							</h4>
							
							<br>

							<p>We would like to tell you a bit about the guild. Things we do and stand for. </p>
										<p>We are a casual social PvE guild. We accept members and there alts. </p>
										<p>All shapes and sizes :) . (lvl 1 - 60)</p>
										<p>In total we have around 200 chars ingame. Which fits to around 100 players. </p>
										<p>Most people know each other from playing SWTOR, being old WOW fanatics, beeing members of the exordium community or by being in real life friends.</p>
							<br>
										<p>The guild chat is in English. We got people from different nationalities. For example: Sweden, England, Belgium and even some strayed Dutch dudes are found here :)</p>
										<p>We actively use teamspeak. You are more then welcome to come online there and have a chat or
										join in our ops group and help out in tactics. Or just have a fun time
										listening in. </p>
										<p>Our teamspeak address is: theexordium.org</p>
										<p>There is no password required.</p>
							<br>
										<p>We do Operation runs multiple times a week. Those are gearing runs / progress runs and old content. And try and do World bosses, PvP, datacron hunting and events where ever we can.</p>
										<p>Also decorating your guild ship is one of them.</p>

										<p>Also I would like to name the officers in the guild:
										<i><b>Garaw, Jamesbondie, Odithos, Zales, Temptress</b></i></p>
										<p>They together with the Ops runners and members
										make Exordium what it is to date!</p>
										<p>Don't want to leave myself out of course. Lifekeeper (Guild master)</p>
							<br>
										<p>Some general and detail guild information: </p>
										<p>Guild rankings and perks that go with it </p>
							<br>
										<p>AFK - Noted for being Long time AFK. </p>
										<p>Alt - Alt character of a Prospect or Member</p>
										<p>Prospect - Newly invited member </p>
										<p>Member - Person who signed up on this website and is actively playing (click here to see how (work in progress))</p>
										<p>Ops runner alt - Name says it all. (decent repair option/ items funded by guild bank)</p>
										<p>Ops runner - Person who regularly does Operations (decent repair option / items funded by guild bank)</p>
										<p>PvP runner - PvP players who main focus is on PvP</p>
										<p>Officer Alt - Alt - Name says it all</p>
										<p>Officer - Main organizers of PvE operations and other guild related stuff. </p>
							<br>
										<p>Log your mains and alts at least every 30 days or risk getting kicked from guild. If you are longer AFK let an officer know so we wont kick you. </p>
							<br>
										<p>Everyone has viewing and placing rights to the guild bank. The higher you go up in the ranking ladder the more you can take out of the bank (items and credits for repairs) </p>
							<br>
										<p>Promoting and demoting will be done at the combined descression of the officers. </p>
							<br>
										<p>Tips / tricks / idea's whatever. Let yourself be heared and let it know in TS / Website / Guildchat etc. Make exordium even better with your input.</p>
							<br>
										<p><ins><b>Operations:</b><ins></p>
										<p>•	Have TS. Be able to hear us.</p>
										<p>•	Have the application starparse http://ixparse.com/ installed.</p>
										<p>•	Coming to Ops means you know the tactics of the story mode and hard mode version. (Dulfy) </p>
										<p>•	20:00 CET invites start. 20:15 we are in Ops and fighting. Ops end 23:00 (later in weekends).</p>
										<p>•	SM Ops mostly has no lootmaster. Need what you need for main spec.</p>
										<p>Greed the rest. If you want stuff for offspec whisper to the person who got the piece. Is it crafting 
										supplies then Ops leader needs for guild bank.</p>
										<p>•	Keep chatter to minimum on the boss fight itself.</p>
										<p>•	Gentleman's rule for unassembled drops in HM versions of Ops. Which means you get 1 and then 
										you pass the next one to someone else. Till all got 1 and we start over. This is per Ops evening.</p>
										<p>•	Recruiting: Do you know a good viable Ops runner (or members) in guild or 
										outside? Or even a good Ops leader? Get her / him in. Wanne become ops runner yourself? Talk to an 
										officer what you need to do. We want more good people. All help to make Exordium even better.</p>
										<p>•	Ops runners are mandatory to be fully augmented (blue) so we go in Ops well prepared.</p>
										<p>•	Stimms, medpacks and adrenals are on the house. Also a bit of repair you get from the guild.
										<p>If there are any questions, suggestions, tips etc let us know. </p>

										<p>We all wish you a warm welcome to the Exordium community. And have fun playing SWTOR</p>
